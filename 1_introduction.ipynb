    "## The Prisoner's Dilemma\n",
    "\n",
    "The **prisoner's dilemma** is a social dilemma game in which individual and collective interests conflict: while both players are individually incentivised to betray the other (by \"**defecting**\"), their collective interests would be best served by **cooperating**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the game has been framed in terms of there being two detainees arrested at the scene of a crime, who while undergoing interrogation in separate rooms both have the choice of either cooperating with each other (by remaining silent on whether the pair had committed a criminal act, perhaps only going to jail for two years each for minor offences) or defecting (by confessing to the authorities in order to go free themselves while condemming the other player to 5 years in jail) with the catch that if they both defect, they collectively spend the longest in jail (4 years each).\n",
    "\n",
    "This dynamic can be encapsulated in the following **payoff matrix** showing the reward to each player:\n",
    "\n",
    "| (A, B)        | **Cooperate** | **Defect**  |\n",
    "|---------------|---------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Cooperate** | (3, 3)        | (0, 5)      |\n",
    "| **Defect**    | (5, 0)        | (1, 1)      |\n",
    "\n",
    "Not knowing what the other player will do, the optimal strategy is to defect, even if both players could maximise their combined total reward by cooperating.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **iterated prisoner's dilemma** (IPD) game, the same prisoners repeatedly face the same situation, accumulating the rewards from each round. As such, if the number of rounds is unknown (or infinite, although that might take a while!), it is possible for the players over time to arrive at some tacit understanding and cooperate with one another so as to maximise their combined payoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1980, Prof Robert Axelrod invited a broad range of participants &ndash; including experts in game theory, economics and political science &ndash; to contribute IPD strategies, which he ran against each other in two celebrated round-robin tournaments. He then analysed the tournament results and winning strategies in two papers: [_Effective Choice in the Prisoner's Dilemma_](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002200278002400101) [1] and [_More Effective Choice in the Prisoner's Dilemma_](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002200278002400301) [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the strategy that won both of Axelrod's eponymous tournaments was a \"tit-for-tat\" strategy of equivalent retaliation: cooperating initially and playing whatever the opponent played in the previous round thereafter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example IPD Game\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now look at a few examples of the iterated prisoner's dilemma in action. In this version of the game, there is a fixed probability of `0.00346` that the game will end after each round and a hard limit of 400 rounds. On average, you can expect each game to have ~289 rounds."
